# What is the SCRPPLE Extension?

The purpose of the Social-Climate Related Pyrogenic Processes and their Landscape Effects (SCRPPLE) is to simulate fire regime change due to climatic and social factors.  The climate is represented primarily via a Fire Weather Index.  Social processes are represented as explicit representation of suppression, accidental ignitions, and prescribed fire.  Human manipulation of the vegetation is represented through fine fuels and ladder fuels.  SCRPPLE uses a very 'data first' philosophy:  The primary mechanisms (ignition, spread, site mortality, and cohort mortality) are parameterized via statistical analyses of landscape-scale data.

# Requirements

You need:

- The [LANDIS-II model v7.0](http://www.landis-ii.org/install) installed on your computer.
- Example files (see below)

# Download

- The latest version of SCRPPLE can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-SCRPPLE/blob/master/deploy/installer/LANDIS-II-V7%20SCRAPPLE%203.2.2-setup.exe). To install it on your computer, launch the installer.

# Example Files

LANDIS-II requires a global parameter file for your scenario, and separate parameter files for each extension.

Example files can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-SCRPPLE/tree/master/Testing/Core7-SCRAPPLE3.2).

# Supporting R-Code

We also provide R-code that has been used to parameterize SCRPPLE.  This R-code is provided 'as is' and no support is implied.  [R code on GitHub](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-SCRPPLE/tree/master/Supporting%20R%20Code)

# Support

If you have a question, please contact Robert Scheller. 
You can also ask for help in the [LANDIS-II users group](http://www.landis-ii.org/users).

If you come across any issue or suspected bug, please post about it in the [issue section of the Github repository](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-SCRPPLE/issues) (GitHub ID required).
